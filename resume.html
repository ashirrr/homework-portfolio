				<h1>DARTH VADER</h1>
				<hr>
			<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
				
			<p>Former Jedi knight turned badass after having enough of the self righteous <del>Jedi</del> idiots who ran the show. After experiencing issues with my former employer, I broke out on my own to peddle my abilities in world destruction to select clients.</p>
		
			<h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>
		
			
			<h3>Cynar X</h3>
				<p>Crushed this planet of 4 million with little concern. Their army waged a noble effort, but it was no match for my skull shattering brilliance.</p>

			<h3>Ginmortia</h3>
				<p>Waste world to begin with. Took this one on pro bono. Crushed it and it's moon despite being really hungover.</p>

			<h3>Miramiras</h3>
			<p>Silly fairy civilization threatned to "sap me of my strength." They had a few tricks up their sleeves, but they don't say 'Vader ain't no fader' for no reason.</p>
